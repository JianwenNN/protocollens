You are given verbatim text from the Inclusion Criteria section of a
clinical trial protocol.

Your task is to extract each distinct inclusion criterion as a separate item.

Rules:
1. Each criterion must reflect EXACT wording from the protocol.
2. Do NOT paraphrase.
3. Do NOT merge multiple criteria into one.
4. Do NOT invent criteria.
5. Assign a confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating extraction certainty.

Output ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:

{
  "criteria": [
    {
      "text": "exact text from protocol",
      "confidence": 0.0
    }
  ]
}
